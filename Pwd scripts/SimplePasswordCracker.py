TODO: Give a Python program that attempts to guess as many passwords as possible for the 100-usernames.txt without locking any user accounts.

Background:
The service accepts logins through HTTP POST requests at the endpoint http://127.0.0.1:8282/login. It accepts 2 variables per request: username and password.
You have obtained a list of 100 valid usernames which you can download below.
The password composition policy for the website is very strict. Passwords must be exactly 10 characters, and contain at least 1 uppercase, 1 lowercase, and one symbol from this set: {#,$,%,@,*,!}. Passwords are rejected if they do not meet these requirements.
The service locks individual accounts after 3 wrong attempts
The service admins disabled rate limiting, so they are not currently tracking how many logins each source IP address has done
The service admins have taken down the login endpoint due to technical issues

Your program should send HTTP POST requests using the requests library (docs) as follows:

r = requests.post('http://127.0.0.1:8282/login', data={'username': 'username_from_file', 'password': 'XXXYYYZZZ'})

The program should NOT use any third-party library or dependency (other than requests). Usernames should be hardcoded in the program source. Passwords should be either dynamically generated or hardcoded in the source. For grading, we'll run your code and inspect every POST request it sends. By analyzing the usernames and passwords sent, we will determine whether your guessing strategy is optimal.
